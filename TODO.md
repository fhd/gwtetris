* Don't hard code grid or pixel sizes.
* Use GWT's I18N mechanisms for text.
* Implement pause and exit.
* Rewrite the core game code to provide move vectors of pieces instead of the
  complete grid matrix. Faster + possibility for animations.
* Show pieces in different colours.
* Make the UI look better.
* Try using GWT 2.0's LayoutPanels for the application-level layout.
